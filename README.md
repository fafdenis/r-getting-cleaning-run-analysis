# Getting and Cleaning Data
This is meant for a course project to show the steps of how to prepare a tidy dataset that can be used for later analysis.

## Contents
* README.md
* CodeBook.md - describes the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean-up the data.
* run_analysis.R - R script to merge, clean-up, transform, and summarize the data.
* run_analysis.text - output file generated by run_analysis.R script.

## Getting Started
1. Read through the CodeBook.md and the run_analysis.R script to have a general understanding of the project, the variables, data transformations, and output file. 
2. Download and place the [data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) in a directory called UCI-HAR-Dataset.
3. Run the run_analysis.R script to generate the tidy dataset.
